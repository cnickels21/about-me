            <h3>Meet the Real Me!</h3>
            <p>Hello! I was born in Colorado, but at two years old my family moved to northern Wisconsin; specifically a
                small town on Lake Superior. Because of this I have always had a natural calling to have both a large
                body of water and mountains in my life. I grew up playing saxophone, but over the years have learned to
                play guitar, bass, and piano. I currently play bass in a band called <a
                    href="https://www.facebook.com/ThemDirtyBones/">Them Dirty Bones</a>. We have one album and one
                national tour under our belts, and we are in the process of writing our second album.</p>
            <p>My parents own a bar and grill as well as a motel back home; currently in their 27<sup>th</sup> year of
                business! This, combined with some unfinished secondary education, has given me a decent background in
                business management and accounting. I have worked in the service industry for most of my life either
                cooking or bartending. I also have some experience with construction through my dad's independent
                contracting business.</p>
            <p>I am happy with what I have accomplished in my life thus far, but I know there is a lot left for me to
                do. I have a natrual wander lust and want to see what the rest of the world has to offer me. More
                specifically, I feel that there is something for me to go experience in Germany. I am hoping that
                through DeltaV, and the skillset they can give me, I will be able to achieve this goal of seeing the
                world through technological innovation.</p>
